# Domino Towers v0.3.0

Simple domino game with a twist.

Click on a domino to build the foundation of your tower, then add matching elements as long as you can!

The lighter windows indicate matching dominoes. When you run out of them, the building of a next tower will be started.

Higher towers mean higher final score!

Every time you add a new domino to a tower, you get the same amount of points as its current height. 

Faster builders gets time bonuses!

Place every domino in less then a second to get multipliers. The faster you are, the higher score you get.

In development:

* Sound effects, music
* Different themes and higher numbers on dominoes
* Special dominoes (joker, bomb, upside-down, shuffle, clone)
* Multiplayer
